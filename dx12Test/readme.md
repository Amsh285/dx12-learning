It focuses on setting up the runtime, handling a window, and creating the basics required for rendering.

## 🔹 Features
- Basic DirectX 12 runtime setup  
- Device & adapter selection  
- Command queue creation  
- Tearing support check  
- Logging & error handling utilities

## 🎯 Purpose
The goal is to understand DirectX 12 step by step and build a foundation for more advanced rendering features.

## 🚧 Current Status
- Runtime initialization ✔  
- Debug layer & info queue setup ✔  
- Swap chain integration (in progress) ⏳  
- Rendering experiments (coming soon)
