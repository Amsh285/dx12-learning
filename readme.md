# Personal Dev Experiments & Learning Projects

This repository is a **collection of personal projects, experiments, and learning exercises**.  
The goal is to explore different technologies, programming concepts, and graphics APIs while documenting progress.

## ðŸš€ Current Projects

### 1. DirectX 12 Practice Project
A small learning project focused on:
- Setting up a DX12 runtime
- Window creation and swap chain management
- Command queue creation and tearing support
- Logging and error handling utilities

_See `dx12Test/README.md` for details._

### 2. [Other projects can be added hereâ€¦]
- Brief description of the project or experiment
- Status or learning goals

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
- Experiment with new APIs and libraries  
- Understand graphics programming and system-level development  
- Keep track of progress and learn from practice projects  

## ðŸ“Œ Notes
- This repo is mainly for personal learning and experimentation  
- Not all projects are polished or complete  
- Code may be experimental and contain temporary hacks

## ðŸ’¡ Future Ideas
- Multi-window DirectX 12 renderer  
- Game engine prototypes  
- Graphics algorithms (pathfinding, mesh processing, etc.)  
- Other experiments with C++, low-level graphics, or system programming
